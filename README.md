I'm a Software Engineer with a strong background in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and scalable systems. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient solutions. Whether it's building out backend APIs, architecting cloud infrastructure, or exploring new frameworks, Iâ€™m always eager to learn and grow.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on cloud-native applications and scalable backend services

ðŸŒ± Right now, Iâ€™m geeking out over cloud, system design patterns, and all the cool ways AI can boost productivity.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration on innovative tech projects, especially in backend and cloud engineering

âš¡ Fun fact: I love exploring new technologies and automating just about anything I can!

Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to explore my repos and connect!
